  <summary><strong>Pharmacoeconomic cost-effectiveness model made in Google Sheets</strong></summary>
  <ul>
    <p>Demonstration that Google Sheets is as capable as Microsoft Excel for creating pharmacoeconomic cost-effectiveness models. The spreadsheet contains a cost-effectiveness model with three states (healthy, sick, dead) that computes the costs and QALYs over the patients' lifetime and calculates their incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The model includes a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, made possible by Google Sheets macros.</p>
